(Coming soon)
TODO:

Main points:

* Will use weirdmathstuff -> MultiplePiecesHandler
* Might try to remove variance between compute tasks by making a lot of compute pieces, shuffling them and giving 100-1000 pieces per task
* How to run
* Still a rough draft, but it works
* Maybe a could submit it to a website that distributes compute? I still have to look into it. (Maybe primegrid.com ?)

Maybe just buy compute...

For example:
https://calculator.aws/#/addService/ec2-enhancement?refid=ap_card

I don't know where I can get the best deal though...

Update:
I was able to write a JAR file that distributes the net_search really easily. All you need to particate is a CPU with 1 GB of ram
and a few MBs of disk space.

I looked at google cloud's offerings, and found out that I could use I could claim a $300 free trial. Once past the free trial,
they charge 4 cents USD an hour per CPU, or over 1 dollar a day per CPU.
Currently, checking the 13x1x1 solutions takes around 500 CPU days, so once the free trial is used, I'll have to use spend around $200 out of pocket.

I don't think I'll be able to justify speeding real money on this project though.
