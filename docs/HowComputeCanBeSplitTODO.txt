(Coming soon)
TODO:

Main points:

* Will use weirdmathstuff -> MultiplePiecesHandler
* Might try to remove variance between compute tasks by making a lot of compute pieces, shuffling them and giving 100-1000 pieces per task
* How to run
* Still a rough draft, but it works
* Maybe a could submit it to a website that distributes compute? I still have to look into it.
