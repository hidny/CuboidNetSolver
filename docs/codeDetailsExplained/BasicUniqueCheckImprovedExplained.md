## BasicUniqueCheckImprovedExplained

This class mainly has a function that checks if a given solution is unique by converting the solution into a solution code,
and checking if that solution code has already been seen through the use of a hashset (it's like a hashtable).
The reason it's slightly complicated is because I tried my best to make this as quick as possible, and made it more complicated in the process.

See SolutionEncodingsExplained.txt to get a better idea of what a solution code is.
